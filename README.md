# matching_engine_and_simulator 

This is a project that can run a order matching simulation according to the users simulation preferences. 

User can determine how many traders, how many different stocks, quantity per stock type and quantity of cash is in the simulation. 

Also, users can determine how many trades should be execute, the range of order quantities and the range of order values. 

This project uses Python and the heap data structure to efficiently store the buy and sell orders.

Also, this project does not include any fancy matching algorithms probably used by real exchanges. 

I was already interested in finance and I got inspired to this project after doing a Leetcode question about order matching. 


So I used my solution to that question as my order matching algorithm in this project.
